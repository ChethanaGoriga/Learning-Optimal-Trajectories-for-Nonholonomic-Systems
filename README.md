# Learning-Optimal-Trajectories-for-Nonholonomic-Systems
Developed a Matlab and Simulink based prototype to implement Iterative learning control methodology for enhancing the performance of the control system through training. 
Trajectory length is minimized during the learning phase as a result of the updated control laws.
This low-cost prototype displays typical problems of vehicles, such as friction, backlash, and wheel deformation, and therefore provides an ideal benchmark for testing the robustness.
